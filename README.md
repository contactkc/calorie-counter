# Calorie Counter
This project is a simple and interactive web-based calorie counter that allows users to track their daily calorie intake and expenditure, and provides feedback on their remaining calories, indicating whether they are in a calorie surplus or deficit.

## Features
- **Daily Calorie Budget**: Users can set their daily calorie budget.
- **Meal Entries**: Users can add multiple entries for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks.
- **Exercise Entries**: Users can add entries for exercise to account for calories burned.
- **Calorie Calculation**: The application calculates the total consumed calories, burned calories, and the remaining calories based on the budget.
- **Clear Functionality**: Users can clear all inputs to reset the form.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using HTML to structure my website layout alongside CSS to make it into a clean and modern feel with a dark theme look. I have used flexbox for layout management and responsive design to ensure the application looks good on different screen sizes. Implemented JavaScript to add interactivity to the application for features such as: adding a new entry for the given selections, calculating the remaining calories based on the budget, consumed calories, and burned calories which also handles invalid inputs and displays the results, and a button to clear all input fields and resets the form.
