# Calorie Counter
This project is a simple and interactive web-based calorie counter that allows users to track their daily calorie intake and expenditure, and provides feedback on their remaining calories, indicating whether they are in a calorie surplus or deficit.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using HTML to structure my website layout alongside CSS to make it into a clean and modern feel with a dark theme look. I have used flexbox for layout management and responsive design to ensure the application looks good on different screen sizes. Implemented JavaScript to add interactivity to the application for features such as: adding a new entry for the given selections, calculating the remaining calories based on the budget, consumed calories, and burned calories which also handles invalid inputs and displays the results, and a button to clear all input fields and resets the form.

## Lessons Learned:

I love going to the gym myself and like tracking my calories from time to time, so I have decided to create my first project with JavaScript by creating an interactive and functional website that focuses on calorie intake. I was able to learn more about how to implement JavaScript in order to manipulate a website and make it interactive. This was a project that taught me more about the syntax and how to target HTML elements to change their values and layout.
